confirm-with-reveal
===================

Replacement for window.confirm() using the Reveal modal popup plugin from Zurb Foundation.

Requires [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), as well as ZURBâ€™s [Reveal](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/reveal.html) plugin.

Overwrites `$.rails.allowAction` from the Rails [jQuery UJS adapter](https://github.com/indirect/jquery-rails) if the latter has been included.

See [example jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/PtVNW/) for a demo.
